ChatGap
=======

ChatGap is a multi-user chat application that allows users to discuss virtually any topic they'd like.
The application is built on top of PhoneGap and uses JQuery Mobile so it can be ported anywhere. The
server-side code uses Tomcat which acts as a container for a simple JAX-RS web service. MongoDB is 
used for the DB since it is schema-less and allows for lots of conurrent connections.

There's still lots of bugs, let me know if you find anything that needs to be fixed. Enjoy!
